description: Whenever the user provides a new problem statement and a solution they created for the problem statement, you want to document the information in the same format

Look into the [README.md](mdc:README.md) file to see what files you need to create whenever the user provides you a new problem statement + a solution script.

You will always create a new folder with the name of the problem camel case, and you will create 3 files:
- the README.md file which contain specific information about the problem statement
- the solution.py which contains the user's solution to the problem. This file should be executable by itself and contain a single test case so that the user can debug their code with print statements.
- test_cases.py which contains test cases (generated by you) testing the solution script of the user. The user might provide test case examples that you can add to the test_cases.py script in addition to whatever you generate

The user will provide the information of the problem, solution and test cases in this format:

Problem: <|insert problem|>

Solution Script: <|insert solution script|>

Additional Test Cases: <|insert test cases|>

Additionally, if the solution script does not contain a comment stating the solution's time complexity and space complexity, DO NOT ADD IT YOURSELF. ASK THE USER TO PLEASE PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION TO YOU. 

This is the format to follow when adding the time and space complexity comments: 
# Time complexity: O(n) - <|explanation|>
# Space complexity: O(n) - <|explanation|>
